The year is 2010.
Microsoft has finally risen from the grave.
The Internet has been revived.
And in the midst of a tech renaissance, **it** happened.
Mind controlled computing.

A start-up company called Chronoworld has begun producing "Mind Visors", virtual reality headsets to go along with their new software, MindSpace, an online world allowing users to browse the Web, chat with friends and live their day to day lives, all from their computers, without needing to leave their house.
It's a hit!

Your name is Beatrice Winters, but you like to be called cw.winterspice@mindspace.net. You're on an adventure. An adventure to travel MindSpace and find all of the crooks, crannies, hooligans, nut cases, psychopaths and other weirdos, but not to expose them. 
Rather, you want to bridge the gap between each "MindCommunity", and bring union to MindSpace.

However, Chronoworld, the people on MindSpace, and your own personal troubles all pose a threat to your objective. 

Will you succeed in bringing unity to the virtual space inside our minds? 
Or will you get banned, or worse, trying?

The future is now, powered by Chronoworld!


Chronospace MindSpace is created by Cinnapoodle, SKCro and brew.
